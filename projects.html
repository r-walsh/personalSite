		<h3 class="post-title">The First Project</h3>
		<p class="post-content">
			My first project was based (extremely) loosely on EA's <a href="https://dragonagekeep.com">Dragon Age Keep</a>. Put simply, this website allows you to adjust decisions made throughout the Dragon Age series and validate your choices based on those selected previously. 
		</p>
		<p class="post-content">
			While the scope of the website was beyond my skill, time, and resources I was still inspired to attempt something loosely similar. The final iteration ended up being a simple color matching game. The player is given 9 squares of 3 different colors and a target color they must match. If the player attempts to select two different colors, or matches three colors that are not the target color, the game will reset.
		</p>
		<p class="post-content">
			Validation of selections was done by comparing background-colors to the target-color and previous selections. This served as my first foray into jQuery, which I found significantly more convenient to use when selecting and manipulating DOM elements than vanilla Javascript.
		</p>

		<p class="post-content">
			A link to the game can be found on <a href="http://codepen.io/r-walsh/pen/JYPYPo">Codepen</a> or <a href="https://github.com/r-walsh/ColorGame">GitHub</a>. Thanks to <a href="swalsh.org">Sean Walsh</a> for suggestions and review.
